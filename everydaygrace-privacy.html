      <p><em>Effective Date: 3/27/25</em></p>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Everyday Grace. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any data or information you provide while using the app.</p>
      
      <h3>No Collection of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We do not collect or store your name, email, or any other personally identifiable information. You can use the app without creating an account or sharing personal details.</p>
      
      <h3>Text Input and Third-Party AI Processing</h3>
      <p>The text you input (e.g., journaling entries or responses) is temporarily sent to a third-party AI service to generate suggestions or prompts. This text data is not linked to your identity and is not stored by us. The AI service processes the text solely to provide in-app functionality, and we do not share any information that can identify you.</p>
      
      <h3>Analytics &amp; Usage Data</h3>
      <p>We do not collect analytic data that can identify individual users. We may view aggregated statistics on app installs or usage, but these statistics do not include personal or device-level information.</p>
      
      <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>Everyday Grace is designed to be accessible to all ages, and since we do not collect any personal data, parents or guardians can feel secure using the app with their children. If you have any concerns, please contact us.</p>
      
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>While we do not store personal data, we implement reasonable measures to ensure the secure transmission of data when it is sent to the third-party AI service.</p>
      
      <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy within the app.</p>
