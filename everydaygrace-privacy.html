  <h1>Everyday Grace - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: [3/27/25]

Introduction
Welcome to Everyday Grace. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any data or information you provide while using the App.
No Collection of Personal Information
We do not collect or store your name, email, or any other personally identifiable information.
You can use the App without creating an account or sharing personal details.
Text Input and Third-Party AI Processing
The text you input (e.g., journaling entries, responses) is temporarily sent to a third-party AI service to generate suggestions or prompts.
This text data is not linked to your identity and is not stored by us.
The third-party AI service processes the text solely to provide in-app functionality (e.g., generating responses). We do not share any information that can identify you.
Analytics & Usage Data
We do not collect analytic data that can identify individual users.
We may view aggregated statistics on app installs or usage (e.g., total number of app downloads), but these statistics do not include personal or device-level info.
Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Everyday Grace does not specifically target children. Because we do not collect any personal data, the App can generally be used by all ages. If you are a parent or guardian with concerns, please contact us.
Security
Although we do not store personal data, we implement reasonable measures to ensure secure transmission of data when it is sent to the third-party AI service.
Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised policy within the App.
