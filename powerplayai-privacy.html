      <p><em>Effective Date: 3/27/25</em></p>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Power Play AI. We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency in our data practices. This policy explains that we do not collect or store any personal data.</p>
      
      <h3>No Collection of Personal or Usage Data</h3>
      <p>The app does not request or capture any personally identifiable information (such as your name or email). We do not record usage data, location data, or device identifiers.</p>
      
      <h3>AI Features</h3>
      <p>All AI-based functionality within Power Play AI operates entirely on your device. The app does not transmit your tasks, schedules, or any text to third-party servers for processing.</p>
      
      <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>Since we do not collect any data, Power Play AI is suitable for users of all ages. However, parental or guardian supervision is recommended for younger users.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>The app is designed so that no user data is stored on remote servers, minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
      
      <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>If we ever modify our practices (for example, by adding optional features that involve data collection), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and notify users within the app.</p>
