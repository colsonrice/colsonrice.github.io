  <h1>Power Play AI - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: [3/27/25]

Introduction
Welcome to Power Play AI. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our data practices—especially since we do not collect or store any personal data.
No Collection of Personal or Usage Data
The App does not request or capture any personally identifiable information (name, email, etc.).
We do not record usage data, location data, or device identifiers.
AI Features
Any AI-based functionality within Power Play AI operates without sending your personal data to external servers.
The App does not transmit your tasks, schedules, or any text to a third party for processing. (If it does, ensure you clarify the minimal or anonymized nature of any data transmitted.)
Children’s Privacy
Since we do not collect or store any data, our App is suitable for users of all ages. However, parental or guardian supervision is always recommended.
Data Security
We have designed the App so that no user data is stored on the device or a remote server. As a result, there is minimal risk of data breach or unauthorized access.
Changes to This Policy
If we ever modify our practices (e.g., add optional cloud sync in the future), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly. Any major changes will be posted within the App.
